# Summary
This programm implements a card learning system/game, 
this is intended to be used to learn from cards you can create in {question_answer.txt}
but you can rename it, if you want.

# Setup guide:
Set the base path to the folder, that this python file is in (the variable `base` below).
It will be the folder,
where this manages the files, it needs in order to keep track of your progress and
also for the source of your question answer pairs.

# run:
You need to have Python 3.11 or later installed

#### in your CLI:
changed command for MACOS beware
``` pip install pygame matplotlib ```

ON MACOS, you might need to install PIL via brew:

only for MACOS: ``` brew install PIL ```
in that case remove the PIL argument from the pip.

#### Now name the variable `question_answer` below to the name of your txt (include the file
ending) and put the txt in the same folder as this python program.

#### Final step: Put your learnable card text/images into the txt you defined in 
question_answer's file. Question answer pairs should always be put 1 line apart of 
each other and also inbetween, so this program can track, where your question and answer 
begins/ends. 

Example:
(the next line would be the first in your question_answer.txt)
This is an example question?

This is an example answer.
The answer is still going.

This is the next question.
The question is still going

The answer.

3rd question

<base path>/photo.png
(the file ends with the last answer, this is also the end of the example. 
Note that single line breaks like in the "is still going" lines are not rendered 
as line breaks).
If you want to put an image as an answer, you can put the path to the image as the answer
line (see example). It supports png, jpeg and jpg, png is preferred. If you put text 
a link to an image, the image will not be rendered, you need to decide.
